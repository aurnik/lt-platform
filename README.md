## Language Transfer

[Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/) is a project by Mihalis Eleftheriou, building audio courses for learning languages, completely free.
You can find all of them on the [Language Transfer website](https://www.languagetransfer.org/free-courses-1).

## LT Platform

### Goals

The Language Transfer platform should be:

- 100% free, like the Language Transfer courses
- Accessible and easy to use for the visually impaired
- Considerate of users in areas with poor network quality, expensive Internet access, or low-end devices
- Free of distractions and annoyances, like advertisements or superfluous notifications
- Self-sustaining: maintainable and easy to build even in the absence of the original maintainers
- Private by design, sharing only anonymous usage statistics
